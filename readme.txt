This is a basic use for the Canvas tag.

JQuery is used to create an effect that is/was going to be like a htc
sense. Its done in a object orientated way which is why jquery.class.js
is included.

Its quite simple, change the arrays at the top of the sense.js file to
set different options (size, speed, colour, transpanrancy etc)

Its a bit of a hack as the entire canvas is redraw each time even if the
pixle doesn't change. This is one of the reasons performance isn't
amazing.
